# NBA-Playoffs

This project analyzed the performance of NBA players in the regular season versus the postseason, focusing on key metrics such as points, assists, and rebounds. The analysis was inspired by critiques of players like James Harden, who are often accused of underperforming in the playoffs compared to their regular-season dominance—where the stakes are higher and championships are won. <br>
We found that Milwaukee Bucks players experienced the most significant increases in points, assists, and rebounds during the 2023/24 NBA postseason. This trend may be related to the absence of Giannis Antetokounmpo due to injury, creating more opportunities for other players to step up. Damian Lillard saw the largest jump in scoring, increasing his average from 24.3 points per game in the regular season to 31.3 points per game in the postseason. <br>
Patrick Beverley posted the highest increase in assists, improving from 2.6 assists per game in the regular season to 5.5 in the playoffs. Khris Middleton showed the most significant rebound improvement, going from 4.7 rebounds per game to 9.2 during the postseason. <br>
